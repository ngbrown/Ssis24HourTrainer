SSIS 24-Hour Trainer
====================

My effort to follow along with the book, 
[_Knight's Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Integration Services 24-Hour Trainer_][1].

The sample databases are at [Wrox's website][2], or I used the official source 
from CodePlex: [Adventure Works for SQL Server 2012][3].
